# ParallelN-bodySimulation
Using Mpi, Pthread, OpenMP, MPI+OpenMP, and CUDA to implement parallel N-body Simulation

PLEASE follow the instructions in the PDF file to replace the main.cpp and CMakeList.txt to build for each parallel version.

Description :
Write a sequential program, a P-thread, and an MPI parallel programs to simulate an astronomical N-body system, but in two-dimensions.  The bodies are initially at rest.  Their initial positions and masses are to be selected randomly (using a random number generator).  Display the movement of the bodies using xlib, or other GUI systems.
